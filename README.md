# Weaklensing measurements for GAMA galxy groups using HSC S16a shape catalog data
Here we provide the weak lensing signal measurements data used in our work DR,SM et al. 2021.
Files are named according to the bin edges and include columns as x,y and yerror.
We also provide the data for the covariance matrix plotted in the paper. The shp_cov_lum is for the group luminosity selection, and the shp_cov_vel is for the velocity dispersion.
