# Subaru HSC weak lensing measurements for GAMA galaxy groups

Here we provide the weak lensing signal measurements data used in our research publication: https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05641.

The weak lensing signal measurements were carried out in two binning schemes:
- Group luminosity
- Group velocity dispersion

Files are named according to the bin edges and include columns as x,y and yerror.

We also provide the data for the covariance matrix for these measurements in each of the directories.
